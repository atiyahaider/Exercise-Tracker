### User Stories

1. Create a user by posting form data 'username' to /api/exercise/new-user and returned will be an object with username and _id.
2. Get an array of all users by getting api/exercise/users with the same info as when creating a user.
3. Add an exercise to any user by posting form data userId(_id), description, duration, and optionally date to /api/exercise/add. If no date is supplied, it will use current date. Returned will be the user object, with the exercise fields added.
4. Retrieve a full exercise log of any user by getting /api/exercise/log with a parameter of userId(_id). Return will be the user object with added array log and count (total exercise count).
5. Retrieve part of the log of any user by passing along optional parameters of 'from date' & 'to date', or 'limit', along with the userid. (Date format yyyy-mm-dd, limit = int)
